# DebugStick
SpigotMC plugin for 1.8 - 1.12.2

Made this some time ago (2020/06/02), so I thought why not publish the source code. Code might look spaghetti-like because at that time I just recently started learning java. I later found out about NMS block states, but I still insisted on writing states for every block myself.. manually + I wanted compatibility.

## Note
I might have changed something and did not finish it, who knows, it was a while ago.

## Archived
**I probably won't update anything here any time soon, if there's an issue, write me a message on SpigotMC and I might reply (I don't visit the website that much anymore)**
